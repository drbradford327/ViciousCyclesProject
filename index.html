            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <h2>We are Vicious Cycles.</h2>
            <p>Vicious Cycles is a local store for bikers. These can be casual bikes, mountain bikes, high-performance
                tricked-out BMX
                bikes, etc. Alternately, these can be Harley Davidson, an American Eagle, mopeds, scooters, Kawasaki’s,
                or
                even concept
                vehicles. The choice of item is up to you. What brands do you want to sell? Or be a dealer for? Vicious
                also
                sells
                accessories. </p>

            <h2>Our Philosphy</h2>

            <p>Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will not
                only
                build your
                bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide service down
                the
                road as you
                need it.</p>

            <p>The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding
                new
                trails are
                definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world and connect
                with
                friends,
                nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.</p>

            <p>Technological advancement, digital exploration and the growing globalization defines the world we live in
                and
                will bring
                more change in the years to come than ever before. It’s a world full of uncertainties where it’s easy to
                get
                lost. But
                bikes are a very rare breed of products that are completely mechanical and analogue. There aren’t many
                products that are
                so simple yet so sophisticated in their designs. Maybe that is what started my excitement for bikes as
                products. The
                process of observing, designing, improving, engineering and producing bikes surely is the second-best
                thing
                ever.</p>
